      h1 Who are those horrible orange men?
      h2 Oh sure! Blame the wizards!
      p If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I can explain. It's very valuable. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

      p But existing is basically all I do! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! One hundred dollars.
      p Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
      h3 Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

      p Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I'm a thing. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

      p Shut up and take my money! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Who are those horrible orange men? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

      h4 Also Zoidberg.
      p Throw her in the brig. You are the last hope of the universe. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

      p Pansy. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. I can explain. It's very valuable.
      p There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
